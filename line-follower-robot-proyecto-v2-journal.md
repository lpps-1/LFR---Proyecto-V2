# 2/4/2026 - Building the 3D Model  

_Time spent: 7.0h_  

### 1- Introduction:
I have prior experience in building line follower robots, I have made over 8-9 robots in total out of which 4 line followers, two RC cars, one sumo robot and one being a 5kg robowar category robot. I mainly specialize in line followers and have won many national level events. In Pakistan I used to participate at high school level but due to lack of competition I moved towards University categories. In which Im victorious till now and the university directors especially mention and regards me for participating. Now lets move towards my design.

So basically this is a version 2 of the original one that i made on perf boards, like I used it as the base as well as the circuit and with two TT gear motors. The gap between the main board and the sensor was like 25 inches which wasnt a good idea due to which it had to be put on my display shelve. But from that design I learnt a lot and improved a lot which I have applied in this design.

### 2- Design Breakdown:
So in this design what I have done is that basically, Im using four TT motors one after another. Im using two on each side each because with two the turning becomes very smooth which is what I need in my line follower. At the very front I will be using a TCRT5000 5 channel array. Even though its basic but to be honest I have used Polulu QTR8A Reflectance Analog Sensors but these cheap digital sensor works better which is evident through the performance in the robotics events that I had participated in. The robot main body has engravings which are the paths for the jumper wire to keep the build clean looking. I have also added a parallel block like you can see before the sensor position there is a straight line type part on which Ill put a TCRT5000 individual sensor on each side. These will be used for detecting cross sections. As in the upcoming event which is one of the biggest robotics event in Pakistan (NERC 26), there track comprises of intersection, through which you have to take a specific path. But this robot is for overall general purposes and intersections are usually added in a track to confuse the bot. To support these parallel blocks for sensor I have added diagonal support for both the performance reason as well as aesthetic reasons. 
Now moving towards the suspended platform. It will have the main PCB which Ill be making through perf board instead of the usually printed one. On the board will have an arduino nano for processing, TB6612FNG as the motor driver, 4 Push buttons, some female headers to easily connect a HC-05 to make the robot RC if needed. Ill also connect an OLED Screen which will run my custom OS. Which I have been designing for 3-4 months. Lastly the model has two semi circled cut which will have two different color LEDs. What they will do is that for example the left side LED is Green colored while the left side will be Blue. Now according to the robot logic Ill add that, if robot is taking a right turn it should turn on the Green LED and when taking left it will turn on the Blue LED. This helps a lot with debugging as sometimes robot takes the opposite turn even though the track conditions are for the different turn. It will be used for debugging purposes and during competition if the wrong LED turns on Ill know to take a retry instead of waiting for the robot to go off course saving crucial time. Ill upload another photo below which will explain the each part location.

![Sensor Array (1)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTgzNDYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--a1728c4ccb61b639eca4c1afc259f973264e1539/Sensor%20Array%20(1).png)

### 3- OLED System:
So here I have clearly marked the model's parts with it's uses. Another thing that I forgot to mention was the OLED position which I have shown here the button will be on the main PCB. As there will be four buttons. OKAY, CANCEL, UP, and DOWN the screen will start with an animation showing the robot name and my team name. The animation will be skipable as during the competition a retry doesnt has that much time. After the animation it will show multiple options such as Black Line, White Line, Sensor Reading Analog, Sensor Reading Digital, Motor Calibration, Sensor Calibration, and finally LED Calibration. The alleviated platform for the PCB has holes for the jumper wires connecting the electronics to the main board. Now Ill upload the side angles photos and back angle photos. Then Ill move to the under side of the robot. Ill label the next photos at the top so it is easier to understand.

### 4- Photos from Various Angles:

### 5- Reinforcement at the Bottom:
Now as you have seen as well as read about the side angles, top, front and back angles. The last part is the bottom part which has the additional support as well as my robotics team's instagram ID and the robot'ss name engraving. I have added the support in the bottom as the heavy parts such as the motors are at the corners of the structure and with the wheels it will create a bend in the middle. To counter that I have used the strongest geometrical shape which divides the force on all side triangles. I have added a straight beam with multiple triangles subtending from it. This helps with keeping the structure durable and firm. Allowing it to last longer and being able to handle more wear and tear. Let me add a picture below which will clear your doubt further.

# 2/5/2026 10 AM - Circuit Diagram   

_Time spent: 5.6h_  

### 1- Introduction:
So today I worked on the circuit design. As I had already mentioned this is my 4th LFR, so I pretty much used the same pinout. But due to having a lot of components Im using all the pins of it both analog and digital one. For LEDs I had to even use the D0 and D1. As these pins are directly hard wired with the ATMega chip, if the LEDs are left connected while uploading code or during serial debugging tasks it will fail. As the LEDs will interfere with the ground state of these serial pins. To counter this Ill make the LEDs removeable so when I need to upload/serial debug Ill just have to remove the LEDs. This will be a hassle at the start as Ill be needing to change values and calibrate the robot. But once calibrated it won't be a big of an issue. Now let me upload the circuit design then Ill start explaining what and why I did such a wiring.

![circuit_image (1)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTg3MTQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--3f33322c501af35c5156490caf58edf54dd035f5/circuit_image%20(1).png)

### 2- Component List:
Yes, I know you'll be confused at the schematics but before explaining it. Let me breakdown what I have used and a brief reason for using it.

**i) Arduino Nano 1x -** Easy to source, and best for this task.

**ii) TCRT5000 5 Channel Array 1x -** Works best for me, as I have tested both the Pololu QTR8A and these in competitions.

**iii) TCRT5000 Individual Sensors 2x -** For detecting cross sections, assist with turns.

**iv) 3S 12.6V Lipo 1x -** LIPOs for its high discharge, 2200mAh as Im using four motors that will drain anything less than 1000mAh easily.

**v) LM2596 Buck Convertor 2x -** What I learnt from my previous build was that, I was powering the VCC (Logic Voltage to be 5v of TB6612FNG) form the nano directly. The nano's linear voltage regulator had been fried which I wasn't aware of. Due to which instead of giving 5V at the 5V pin. Nano was giving out 8V which made around 3-4 TB6612FNG explode as I couldn't find the problem. To tackle this Im using two bucks one for 12v to feed into TB and one moderated for 5v for Nano and TB's VCC. By using a buck on TB's VM it helps me by keeping the same RPM as you know Im not using encoders if the battery voltage drops the same value which was set 255 wont be the same at 8V. It will be definitely slower to tackle this and keep a consistent voltage Im using a second buck.

**vi) TT Motors 4x -** For movement and four for smoother turning.

**vii) OLED 1x -** Will be used to operate my custom OS which I have been working on for over 4 months and is almost complete. It will have multiple menu options which can be selected through the four push buttons which I have used.

**viii) Push Buttons 4x -** For the selection of menu options. OKAY, CANCEL, UP and DOWN they will be assigned these functions. I have connected each 4-Pin push button to only GND and a signal pin not connecting it to 5V to reduce wiring as it can be operated by using the internal pull up function in the code.

**ix) TB6612FNG 1x -** Motor driver for controlling the motors. I have chosen it as it transfers electricity to motors with the efficiency of about 70 - 80% unlike l298n which wastes lots of voltage as heat.

**x) LEDs 2x -** Lastly two LEDs, for debugging purposes, as they will turn on depending on the robots decision of turning. This will help me in debugging and also during competition it will tell me that the robot will go off course without me having to wait for it to go off course. Saving crucial time and allowing me to put it back on the track quickly.

### 3- Explanation: 
So, I think most of your questions will be cleared about the component selection. The thing that took me the longest was to find two pins for the LEDs but unfortunately I had already used all of them. But I found a solution that I can plug them to D0 and D1 although these are directly connected to the ATMega and are responsible for uploading of the code as well as serial monitor reading. So when I'll need to upload the code or serial read I'll have to remove the LEDs or the code wont upload. As the LED interferes with the serial signals ground state and causes voltage spikes. This issue will be painful only during the assembly as once the robot is calibrated I won't be required to remove them and as for the speed setting I'll use the push buttons. What I want is that to make a mobile type application software meaning during competition if I want to change some setting I dont have to use my laptop to change speeds, calibration, threshold, etc. By making the OS all of these will be done through the four push buttons Im using like changing the speed, Ill make a counter which increases with each press and then once clicked saved the setting is changed in the code means changing the PWM value of motors. Same logic will be applied for checking sensor assignments and threshold changes. What I have planned is to add a single 3" by 3" server fan. Which I already have its very strong and very good with cooling which I had used in my old build too. As during calibration repeated use of the motors and the region (Pakistan, Lahore. In summer it gets up to 48C Degrees) where I live TT motors get hot.   

# 2/5/2026 2 PM - Downloaded the FreeCAD  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

Now to apply for project design, there is a requirement of uploading a STEP file but I used TinkerCAD for designing due to which, Ill first have to download freeCAD then convert the STL file into STEP through it. Along with that Im making the github repository. In which Im done with uploading the READMe and screen shot of the 3D model. Now Im working on making the 3D model file into STEP and after that Ill use the freeCAD for adding electronics to my design as it is also a requirement for applying.

![Screenshot (294)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTg4NDcsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--a15edf79578e633c87be7d2ba8f0a34e2969dec9/Screenshot%20(294).png)
   

# 2/6/2026 - Converted my STL file into STEP file  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

As I used tinkerCAD for designing my 3D model, due to which it was in STL. and OBJ. only while the guidelines for project submission is to have a STEP file. The main difference is that the STL and OBJ only consist of triangles while STEP allows more complex geometric shapes and it was also evident as the STL file was only 3MB while the STEP file was 177MB. It took me more than two hours to convert the STL file into STEP. Then finally I found a YouTube tutorial which guided me how to do it. I tried with AutoDesk Fusion but it didnt work then I downloaded FreeCAD and it finally worked. Along with this I took multiple screenshot of the model and organized them. This took me about three hours as the STEP file was over 25MB it wasnt able to be uploaded directly as the max allowed from the website was only 25MB and from the gitBASH it only allows 100MB max. Due to this I used Google Drive to externally save the file and gave the link in a text document.

# 2/9/2026 7:11 AM - The Coding Part V1  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

### 1) Introduction:
Now Ill be talking about the coding part. I have divided the coding files into these parts.
 - Motor Test
 - Sensor Position Test
 - LFR Code
 - LFR Code Combined with the OLED and Animations
 
Each of these will be consider as a part for example, Part V1 will be talking about motor test.

### 2) Code Explanation:
The code starts with the importing of the SparkFun_TB6612FNG library which you'll have to download from the browser you use or from github. Using this library shortens the code as without it you have to code like this:

**Without the library**
   Void Forward() {
     AIN1(digitalWrite, HIGH);
     AIN2(digitalWrite, LOW);
     PWMA(AnalogWrite, 255);
     BIN1(digitalWrite, HIGH);
     BIN2(digitalWrite, LOW);
     PWMB(AnalogWrite, 255);

This makes the code larger and a bit complex on the other hand using the sparkfun library this code can be easily written like this only in two lines!

**With the library**
Motor motorA(AIN1, AIN2, PWMA, 1, STBY);
Motor motorB(BIN1, BIN2, PWMB, 1, STBY);

   Void Backward() {
    motorA.drive(255);
    motorB.drive(-255);

The only difference is that you will have to define two integers at the top such as motorA and motorB after it you can just tell the motor to driver and the numerical value in the brackets tell the speed and if negative sign is added to the numerical value it makes the tyre spin backward. So now you may be wondering what this could does. By using this could you can check the motor directions as you know we are using TB6612FNG which officially supports two motors but if we common the wires of the two motors on each side we can use four motors and this works with more motors too, but depends on their current draw and voltages. This could makes the motor move forward for few second, then backward, then left and finally right. As we dont have the traditional steering system we make the robot turn by the following method. Consider if we want the motor to take the left turn we can do it by the following code

leftmotor.drive(-200);
rightmotor.drive(200);

To take a turn we will have to make the same side of motors go in reverse as the turn. If we want a right turn we will make the the right side go reverse while left one go forward.

# 2/9/2026 7:22 AM - The Coding Part V2  

_Time spent: 0.8h_  

### 1- Introduction:
Now we will be talking about the Sensor Position Testing Code. In my line following code Im using a list like:
static int sensorPins[NUM_SENSORS] = {A6, A3, A2, A1, A0};
By using a list I can directly assign there respective thresholds as well. During line following as I have already told Im using the if-else logic instead of the PID one. The middle of the list is declared as C (center) then the right side from C meaning A1 and A0 as R1 and R2. R1 helps with slight turns meaning the correction on the line while R2 guides with the turn detection as well as the execution of the turns. A3 and A6 are L1 and L2 respectively, same logic is applied to them as well. The line following code main goal is the always keep the C on the line by using the left side and right side readings it helps with correction and turns. Making the robot follow the black line.

### 2- Explanation:
Now I will be moving towards the coding part, in this code nothing happens only the serial read and this code's sole purpose is to check if the sensors are correctly assign meaning it shouldnt be like that the C is printed on the serial monitor while R2 is on the line. The code helps with checking if the wires are correctly connected if not then we can fix it through software instead of changing the wiring. This makes it much easier as if the line following code is directly ran, it will behave weirdly and using the line following code to check the sensor assignment will be very hard and difficult and wont be efficient for this task. I have written the code beforehand and all the coding has been tested on my old LFRs, but I do have made some changes in the code for my new LFR Proyecto V2.


![Screenshot (297)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTAxMDgxLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--85498a6a547c77f1c7ce1df25ef1d10240147695/Screenshot%20(297).png)
  

# 2/10/2026 12:25 PM - The Coding Part V3  

_Time spent: 15.5h_  

### 1) Introduction:
Today Ill be talking about the line following logic. Instead of PID  I have adopted a unique if-else logic. Ill explain below.

### 2) Explanation:
Most LFR take turns according to the current situation like if the R1, R2 and maybe C is on the line it initiates the right turn. This logic is more reactive but sometimes there are T sections on which this logic is completely useless as the robot gets stuck in a loop. To tackle this the code Im using initiates the turn after all the sensor gets off the line then it checks the integer last seen. What last seen does is that it check which sensors were low before all sensors got high. If R1, R2 and maybe C were low before getting high the robot will know its a right turn and it will spin clockwise until C is back on the line. Same logic is used on the line tracing but last seen isnt used as much but it helps in a rare situation. As you know we cant achieve perfect wheel alignment and due to macro level differences in motors, each motor spins at a different RPM which makes the robot go in one direction slightly when moving forward. As the turn is very slow sometimes C was low and out of no where all the sensor gets HIGH the scenario happens that the C sensor and either R1 or L1 are just next to the line but they dont give any reading, confusing the bot. To tackle this I have added for the first time like after running if this happens robot wont have any previous data regarding last seen, so it just turns clockwise until any of the robot's sensor gets on the line then it corrects it self. If the situation occurs later on the robot is able to correct it self based on the previous saved last seen. In this code the calibration and threshold is already defined which can be changed by using the sensor assignment / sensor reading code to find the threshold of each sensor. Lastly if I want to follow a white line Ill inverse the > signs which will make the robot trace inversely. I have perfected this code logic manually by testing on my previous robot. It took about 15H to 16H as I have to test each change manually on the robot and perfect the values and logic. This code works like a charm, Ill try to upload the videos of this code working on my old robot.

![Screenshot (298)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTAxNjMzLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--1fa2f3c1488dee674010b4d75c5606ecc4e679d6/Screenshot%20(298).png)
  

# 2/10/2026 12:44 PM - The Coding Part V4  

_Time spent: 16.0h_  

### 1) Introduction:
This is the main code which runs the LFR code as well as my custom OS. Ill explain the code in the following method:
  - main_.ino
  - menu.h
  - animation.h
  - logo.h
  - rc_mode.h
  - black_line.h
  - white_line.h
As you can see I have divided the code into tabs which I can call in the main file like libraries making the code more manageable and easy to modify.

### 2) main_.ino:
This is the main file which calls all the tabs in which distinct code is written. It handles all the loops as well as the button input. It allows the code to run and from here I can mainly change what the code do. If I want to disable a function Ill just have to remove the import at the top. It also mainly handle the button menu as buttons will be running forever so they need to be described here.

![Screenshot (299)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTAxNjQ0LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--bc9e3af2f7e98502144953b3c574ba9d5c8fe247/Screenshot%20(299).png)

### 3) menu.h:
Now this file contains all the menu options like the ones I talked about earlier (sensor calibration, digital values, etc). This file has all the menu options and also describes them. Some of few which are larger for example like black.h and white.h they are not directly defined in this file as it will make the code longer. Only shorter parts like motor test, calibration, etc are described here. Through this file we can add/remove any function as well as we can edit it. It also deals with the scrolling mechanism as well as entering/existing and finally the animation skipping part.

![Screenshot (300)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTAxNjUwLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--357ae287e9185075ece96bae54b8a9efd9b104bd/Screenshot%20(300).png)

### 4) animation.h:
This file deals with the starting animation which first shows the logo of my team (LPPS) it shows the logo as well as the name of my team. Then it shows the name of the robot model and version of the robot. This animation lasts about 4-5 secs. This is added solely for aesthetics due to which it is skippable as during competition you dont have enough time to wait for the boot up screen.

![Screenshot (301)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTAxNjUxLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--919e9921dc92ee926af5907eea6565731c21a2c1/Screenshot%20(301).png)

### 5) logo.h:
As you know to show an image on the OLED you first have to convert into a bitmap which can be done by using online free softwares. I was using a colored image first to be converted into bitmap the code went over 16k+ lines due to which I had to downsize the logo as well as convert it into a black and white image. After doing that it is still 100+ lines. The logo is directly imported from here to the animation file.

![Screenshot (302)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTAxNjUyLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--21ee32986848668bbf7395eb989c1df3eaf75b55/Screenshot%20(302).png)

### 6) rc_mode.h:
This mode is under development which I have been testing. When this option is selected the screen shows ready to pair then once a specific character is sent form the connected device it shows the device name and says connected to blah blah. To be able to use the rc_mode you have to connect a HC-05 without it wont work. It uses the serial.bt and use the character communication for controlling the motors.

![Screenshot (303)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTAxNjUzLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--b92ef151129fb16dfd2862263a9cf72cbb9b93f8/Screenshot%20(303).png)

### 7) black_line.h:
This file contains the actual line following code which I explained in the earlier journal. I have made the line following code a different file so it is easier to change the values of the motor PWM and sensor thresholds. 

![Screenshot (304)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTAxNjU0LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--3dbd740d21246248e297c071ef3e56289ddec59d/Screenshot%20(304).png)

### 8) white_line.h:
It will have the inverse following which I had also explained in the previous journal. This code file isnt made yet which will also be added in future as only the signs have to be changed to make it follow white line.

### 9) Other Modes:
Now lastly the calibration and reading modes. As I had mentioned before my final exams are near so I had stopped working on my OS which I will complete after my exams and it is nearly finish as you can see. Ill upload the videos of the animation screen and OS function on the github make sure to see them its pretty cool ig. As this had to be done manually each change had to be checked on the display and I had to also make sure no other modes are affected this took the longest. I had been working on this OS for over 3-4 months now. As this is general code like it will be used in my other projects so I will add the average time to setup the code for each build.

# 2/13/2026 4 AM - CAD with Electronics  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

I had already made the 3D design. But the requirement of submissions narrates that the CAD file should have all of the electronics in the file. As I didnt have access to autofusion I used TinkerCAD for this task. Now Ill be converting this STL file into STEP using freeCAD

Just got done with organizing the images of the 3D model. Made two folders one with my basic model and the other one with electronics on. Uploaded the STEP files using google drive as they are 400MB+. Direct upload wasn't possible. Now Ill be working on the OS to show the animation and skipping everything that I had programmed.

Today I made the last changes to my github before the submission. As the submission requires screen shots of the add to cart price. I was changing the the BOM as I had forgot to add the shipping and handling. Also battery was not being imported to Pakistan so I had to see some local batteries now the list is fully updated.
